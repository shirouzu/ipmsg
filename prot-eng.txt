About IP Messenger
	This is a Send/Receive message service using the TCP/UDP Port.

  2.Command format(Use all character strings)

     1) Command(Format version-1)

	Ver(1) : PacketNo : SenderName : SenderHost : CommandNo : AdditionalSection

     2) An example for Message Send/Receive by using the current command format

	"1:100:shirouzu:jupiter:32:Hello"


  3.Command process overview

     1) Member recognition

	An IPMSG_BR_ENTRY command notifies a new entry to the current
	members at start-up.

	All members add the new member to their list after getting a notification message.
	An IPMSG_ANSENTRY command sends a message back to the new member.

	The new member gets the current member data by a
	IPMSG_ANSENTRY command. All members can communicate as long as an 
	IP packet exists.

	An IPMSG_BR_ABSENCE command broadcasts absence mode cancel or 
	nickname change to all members. However, an IPMSG_ANSENTRY command 
	does not send a message back, which is different from an IPMSG_BR_ENTRY 
	command.

	IPMSG_BR_ENTRY, IPMSG_ANSENTRY, and IPMSG_BR_ABSENCE commands 
	use an IPMSG_ABSENCEOPT flag for absence mode. Input a nickname to 
	additional command.
	Add an IPMSG_DIALUPOPT flag for dial-up users who can't be reached by 
	a broadcast command.  A member recognition command needs to be 
	sent individually to the members with this optional flag. 

	(Extended group)IPMSG_BR_ENTRY and IPMSG_BR_ABSENCE commands 
	sends a group name by adding the new group name after the current 
	command format character strings (Input '\0' between the current 
	command and extended name).

     2) Send/Receive Message
	Send Message uses an IPMSG_SENDMSG command that can input a message
	in the extended area. 
	Receive Message sends back an IPMSG_RECVMSG command only 
	if an IPMSG_SENDCHECKOPT flag is ON. Input the original packet number 
	to the extended area. 

	Broadcast Message Send uses an IPMSG_BOADCASTOPT command 
	and an IPMSG_SENDMSG flag should be ON. 
	Auto-Send packet(absence notice) needs to be added to IPMSG_AUTORETOPT
	for ping-pong protection. If either one or another packet is ON, then
	confirmation/auto-send packet is not sent back. 

	Send Message Sealing needs to be an IPMSG_SECRETOPT packet ON. 
	In this case, Receive Message sends an IPMSG_READMSG command.
	Input the original packet number to the extended area.

	(Additional IPMSG_NOADDLISTOPT)
	When receiving an IPMSG_SENDMSG packet from a host that is 
	not on your Send/Receive list, IPMsg will either confirm a host by 
	sending an IPMSG_BR_ENTRY command or add a host name to 
	the Send/Receive list. 
	However, single-shot Message Send/Receive action needs to be avoided. 
	Add an IPMSG_NOADDLISTOPT flag to an IPMSG_SENDMSG command.

	(Additional IPMSG_READCHECKOPT from version-8)
	When an IPMSG_READMSG command contains an IPMSG_READCHECKOPT flag, 
	IPMsg process is the same as IPMSG_SENDMSG with an 
	IPMSG_SENDCHECKOPT flag. 
	However, Send Message uses an IPMSG_ANSREADMSG command,  
	not IPMSG_RECVMSG.

     3) Message Send/Receive Å|encrypted extension (Added in the version-9)

	Use the combination of Public-key(RSA) and common key(RC2/Blowfish).
	(Encrypted extension area is used in hex format.)

	(Public key acquisition)Send an IPMSG_GETPUBKEY command to Receive
	Message. Receive Message gets an IPMSG_ANSPUBKEY that 
	means receiving RSA public key from Send Message.

	IPMSG_GETPUBKEY/IPMSG_ANSPUBKEY both require the value which is
	encryption capability (Exp. IPMSG_RSA_1024) flag uses "OR" at first
	part of extension  

	In addition, In IPMSG_ANSPUBKEY, public key written as EE-NNNNNN
	E=ExponentÅAN=method)devide by ':'. and Input the Fdelimiter '-' 
	between E and N.

	This sequence can be skipped after the 2nd Send/Receive process by 
	memorizing public key and encrypted data. 
	
	(Encrypted message)After a sender creates a common key that is 
	supported both sender and receiver, a common key can encrypt a message. 
	In addition, a receiver's public key encrypts the common key.


	(Encrypted message transmission) IPMSG_ENCRYPTOPT is used in
	IPMSG_SENDMSG. At the first part of extension, input the value which
	is 'or' resoult from Convination of public key and common key type . 
	Then use common key which encrypt with public key devide by ':'.
	Then input message which is eccrypted by public key devide by ':'.
	If both supports IPMSG_SIGN_XXX, then add ':' and signeture. 

	Also, In the method of encode padding, PKCS#1ECB key is used for RSA, 
	PKCS#5 CBC common key is used for RC2/blowfish.

	Also, The Packet related to Entry manifestation the capability of 
	ecryption support using  IPMSG_ENCRYPTOPT

     4) Extension with file attachment(Available from version-9)

	An IPMSG_SENDMSG command with an IPMSG_FILEATTACHOPT flag for 
	File transfer (download permission)notification sends a message
	with attachment. 
	Input '\0' after the message and attachment file data.
	

	fileID:filename:size:mtime:fileattr[:extend-attr=val1
	[,val2...][:extend-attr2=...]]:\a:fileID...
	(size, mtime, and fileattr describe hex format. 
	 If a filename contains ':', please replace with "::".)

	When Receive Message downloads an attachment file, an IPMSG_GETFILEDATA 
	command requests a data transmission packet to the TCP port that is the same number  
	as the UDP sending port number. Input packetID:fileID:offset to the extended area. 
	(Use all hex format.)
	File Transfer side receives the request. After recognizing that it's a correct request, 
	then send the specified data (no format)

	When the data receiving side downloads a hierarchical attachment file, 
	use an IPMSG_GETDIRFILES command and input a packetID:fileID
	to the extended area and send a data transmission request packet. 
	(all hex format)

	Data sending side sends the following hierarchical data format.
	header-size:filename:file-size:fileattr[:extend-attr=val1
	[,val2...][:extend-attr2=...]]:contents-data
	Next headersize: Next filename...
	(All hex format except for filename and contetns-data)

	header-size is from the beginning of header-size to the delimiter ':' 
	that is before contents-data. extend-attr can be omitted and used multiple 
	extended attributes. Use '=' for data input. 

	When fileattr is IPMSG_FILE_DIR, IPMsg recognizes that it is automatically
	in the directory, the next file data is after the directory.

	When fileattr is IPMSG_FILE_RETPARENT, IMPsg recognizes that it returns 
	to the parent directory. In this case, File name is always "." and the attribute 
	value is the current directory data.

	Sending process starts from the attachment directly and returns the
	IPMSG_FILE_RETPARENT command to the attachment directory. 

	Add an IPMSG_FILEATTACHOPT flag for an Entry packet to support the 
	attachment file.

     5) Other commands

	When acquiring different versions, send an IPMSG_GETINFO command.
	Receiving side sends the version information character string to
	extended area.

	Send an IPMSG_GETABSENCEINFO command for acquiring an absence message.
	Receiving side sends an IPMSG_SENDABSENCEINFO back if the status is absence mode.
	If the status is not absence mode, a character string "Not absence mode" will be sent back.

     6) Confirmation/Retry

	If a confirmation packet for IPMSG_SENDMSG or IPMSG_RECVMSG is not delivered
	within a specified time, then it will be sent again. 
	A number of retry actions or interval period is depended on the current condition. 


  4. Other

     1) Linefeed

	Linefeed characters in Send Message is standardized with UNIX type ('0x0a').
	Please change if needed. 

     2) Delimiter ':'

	':' is used as a delimiter. You can't use this delimiter for user name 
	and host name. 
	If the use/host names contain a ':', please replace with another sign, 
	for an example ';'. 
	Although using this delimiter isn't problem as yet, I may create an 
	escape sequence.
